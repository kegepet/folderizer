# folderizer
Just a little script that puts loose files into their own automatically named folder (minus extension).

```
/path/to/folderizer /path/to/targetdirectory
```
The above line demonstrates how easy it is to use folderizer. All it does is takes all the loose files in the ***target*** directory, and places them into their own respective folders, each named according to the file name, but without the extension.
